## Question 3

Make a new agent that uses alpha-beta pruning to more efficiently explore the minimax tree, in AlphaBetaAgent. Again, your algorithm will be slightly more general than the pseudocode from lecture, so part of the challenge is to extend the alpha-beta pruning logic appropriately to multiple minimizer agents.

You should see a speed-up (perhaps depth 3 alpha-beta will run as fast as depth 2 minimax). Ideally, depth 3 on smallClassic should run in just a few seconds per move or faster.

```
python pacman.py -p AlphaBetaAgent -a depth=3 -l smallClassic
```

The AlphaBetaAgent minimax values should be identical to the MinimaxAgent minimax values, although the actions it selects can vary because of different tie-breaking behavior. Again, the minimax values of the initial state in the minimaxClassic layout are 9, 8, 7 and -492 for depths 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.

Grading: Because we check your code to determine whether it explores the correct number of states, it is important that you perform alpha-beta pruning without reordering children. In other words, successor states should always be processed in the order returned by GameState.getLegalActions. Again, do not call GameState.generateSuccessor more than necessary.

_You must not prune on equality in order to match the set of states explored by our autograder_. (Indeed, alternatively, but incompatible with our autograder, would be to also allow for pruning on equality and invoke alpha-beta once on each child of the root node, but this will not match the autograder.)

The pseudo-code below represents the algorithm you should implement for this question.

```
α: MAX’s best option on path to root
β: MIN’s best option on path to root

def max-value(state, α, β):
    initialize v = -∞
    for each successor of state:
        v = max(v, value(successor, α, β))
        if v > β return v
        α = max(α, v)
    return v

def min-value(state, α, β):
    initialize v = +∞
    for each successor of state:
        v = min(v, value(successor, α, β))
        if v < α return v
        β = min(β, v)
    return v
```

To test and debug your code, run

```
python autograder.py -q q3
```

This will show what your algorithm does on a number of small trees, as well as a pacman game. To run it without graphics, use:

```
python autograder.py -q q3 --no-graphics
```

The correct implementation of alpha-beta pruning will lead to Pacman losing some of the tests. This is not a problem: as it is correct behaviour, it will pass the tests.
