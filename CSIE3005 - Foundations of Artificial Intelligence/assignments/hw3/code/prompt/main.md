Now you are a python programmer excel at machine learning, please complete the following tasks:

- You MUST use the provided sample code @/hw3\hw3.py  as a starting point for your implementation.
- You are only allowed to use pandas, numpy, and Python Built-in libraries.

1. Dataset
   - Classification task: Iris dataset @/hw3/dataset/iris/ 
   - Regression task: Boston Housing dataset @/hw3/dataset/BostonHousing.csv 
2. Preprocessing
   - Load and split the dataset into train and test sets (70% train, 30% test).
   - Implement feature scaling: normalize or standardize features based on your choice.
3. Models
   - Implement a linear model (logistic regression for classification, linear regression for regression).
   - Implement a nonlinear model (decision tree for classification, decision tree for regression).
   - Implement a random forest model for classification and regression).
4. Training
   - Implement gradient descent for logistic and linear regression.
   - Implement a basic algorithm for building a decision tree.
   - Implement a basic algorithm for building a random forest.
5. Evaluation
   - Implement evaluation metrics: accuracy for classification, mean squared error (MSE) for regression.
   - Compare the performance of linear and nonlinear models on both datasets.
