## Steps
In this homework, I used an existing repository that I created at the beginning of this course.  
The test script and the program being tested are from hw1 of this course, since I found it a waste of time to write an additional, unnecessary script for hw2.

Here are my steps:  
*All steps were done on GitHub using the GUI.*
1. Created an **issue template** to suggest something.
2. Created an **issue** to recommend NTU.
3. Created a **GitHub Action** `pytest-hw1.yml` to automatically test hw1's code using `pytest` when pushing.
4. Created two **branches**: `hw1-p` and `hw1-f`.
5. Added a comment to hw1's code and pushed to `hw1-p`.
6. Added a number to intentionally break hw1's code and pushed to `hw1-f`.
7. Created **pull requests** for both `hw1-p` and `hw1-f` to merge into `main`.
8. Wrote comments for both pull requests.
